SYNOPSIS
      use CHI::Config;

      my $config = CHI::Config->new(
        defaults => [
          # Defaults indeed has to mimic the source file for future purposes
          # ie: I plan to make some objects ( such as serializers )
          # be configurable as well and they can't really be defined as-is in JSON
          {
              type => 'driver',
              name => 'myproject.roflmayo',
              config => {
                  # Arguments to CHI->new()
              },
          },
        ],
      );

      my $cache = $config->get_cache('myproject.roflmayo');

      # Do stuff with $cache and get default behaviour

      # User creates ~/.chi/config.json
      [
        {
          'type' : 'driver',
          'name' : 'myproject.roflmayo',
          'config': {
             # CHI CONFIG HERE
          },
        }
      ]

      my $cache = $config->get_cache('myproject.roflmayo');  # Now gets user defined copy
